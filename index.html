        <p>First of all, welcome to my website. I would like to tell you who I am and what i'm currently working on. </p>
        <p>
            I'm currently trying to learn how to do more dev stuff eg. frontend - and backend coding. Currently working on HTML, CSS and JAVA. Ive done plenty of coding in HAMK (Häme University of Applied of Sciences) as a major but I havent really work on coding yet. A dream is coming a full time
            full stack developer and working in software development in the future. After I've done my pratice, I would like to get a job as a junior developer to learn all the tricks and tips and develop myself into a next level as a future SW developer.
        </p>
